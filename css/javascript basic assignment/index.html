      <h1>javascript basics</h1>
      <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scrpting language. JavaScript is extremly popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
       environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
       <p> <a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>
        JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - image a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffe, a 
        variable hold a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. 
       <code>var x;</code> </p>
       <p><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a>
       Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it,giving our variable a value to hold The = Assignment operator assigns a value to a variable <code>var x = 10;</code></p>
       <p> <a href="#">Data Types</a>
       Data Types are in important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean-<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>
       <code>null</code> - aka a nothing number -42 or or 3.141592; String <code>"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</code> Array- <code>[1,'coding',2,'Dojo']</code> and Object- <code>{first_name:'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</code> </p>
       <p> <a href="#">Conditionals</a>
       When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hittting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met you can use conditions statements in your code to accomplish this. There are teh following conditional statements: <code>if</code> a specified condition is true, do this in our code block; <code>else if</code> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <code>else</code> we execute this block of code</p>
       <p> <a href="#">Loops</a>
       There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track for times and then you stop. Thats a loops</p>
       <p><a href="#">Function</a>
       Functions are an encaspulation of code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk form Ikea we Open up the instruction manual and get started first we screw the legs to the table top; next we palce th table the right way up. Done! we finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our Function over and over and over agian </p>
